#### Add New Object

Use this tab to expand your library. The **Nova App** helps you automate data entry using professional astronomical databases.

**Method 1: Automatic Search (Recommended)**

1.  Enter an **Object ID** (e.g., "M31", "NGC 7000", "Gaia 123...").
2.  Click **Search**.
3.  Nova will check your local library first. If it's not found, it queries the **SIMBAD** database.
4.  If found, the fields (RA, DEC, Magnitude, Size, Type) will auto-populate.
5.  Click **Confirm Add** to save it to your library. (you can also click **edit** if you want to change the automatically filled in content, e.g. the name)

**Method 2: Manual Entry**

If you want to add a target not found by the automatic search:

1.  Fill in the **Object ID** and **Name**.
2.  Manually type the **RA** and **DEC** coordinates.
3.  Fill in optional stats like Magnitude or Constellation.
4.  Click **Confirm Add**.

**Adding Notes Immediately**

You can add your **Private Notes** (e.g., "Mosaic plan") or **Shared Notes** right here before saving, so your object is ready to go the moment it is added.
