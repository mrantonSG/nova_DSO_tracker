#### Shared Items

The **Shared Items** tab connects you to the wider community on your Nova instance. It allows you to browse and import data that other users have chosen to share, saving you time on data entry and helping you discover new targets.

**Browsing Shared Data**
The tab is divided into three sections to help you find specific types of shared content:

* **Shared Objects:** Explore targets other users are imaging. Click the **View** button in the "Notes" column to read any tips, framing ideas, or descriptions the owner has attached.
* **Shared Views:** Import "Saved Views" (filters) created by others to quickly access specific objects and filter settings.
* **Shared Components:** Find telescope, camera, or reducer definitions. Importing these is much faster than looking up and typing in technical specifications manually.

**Filtering**
Each table has a **Filter Row** at the top. You can type in these boxes to instantly search by **Name**, **Type**, or **Shared By** username to find exactly what you need.

**Importing Items**

* **Action:** Click the **Import** button next to any item to copy it into your own configuration.
* **Status Indicators:**
    * **Imported:** You already have a copy of this item.
    * **Owner:** You are the one who shared this item.
