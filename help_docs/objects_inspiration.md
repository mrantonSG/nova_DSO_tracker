###  Help: Managing Inspiration Content

The **Inspiration Content** section allows you to add images and descriptive summaries to your objects. These details populate the tiles in the **Inspiration Tab** on your main dashboard, giving you a visual guide to your targets.

You can edit these fields when **Adding a New Object** or by updating an existing one in **Manage My Objects**.

####  Image Settings

These fields determine the background image displayed on the Inspiration tile.

* **Image URL:** Paste the direct link to the image file here.
* *Tip:* The URL should usually end in `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.webp`. Ensure it is a direct link to the image, not the webpage containing the image.


* **Img Credit:** Enter the name of the photographer, observatory, or agency (e.g., "NASA", "John Doe", "DSS2"). This text appears as a badge on the image.
* **Image Source Link:** Paste the URL of the website where you found the image (e.g., the APOD page or Astrobin post). This allows users to click through to see the original source.

####  Description Settings

These fields provide the text summary overlaying the tile.

* **Description Text:** Enter a short, engaging summary of the object.
* *Tip:* Keep it brief (1-3 sentences) so it fits neatly on the card.


* **Text Credit:** Attribute the source of the description (e.g., "Wikipedia", "The Sky Live").
* **Text Source Link:** Paste the URL where the description text came from.

####  Quick Tips

* **Leave it blank?** If you leave the Image URL blank, the Nova App will attempt to auto-load a DSS2 (Digitized Sky Survey) image if coordinates are available.
* **https:** Always use secure (`https://`) links to ensure images load correctly in all browsers.
