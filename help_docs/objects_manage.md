#### Manage My Objects

This is the central control room for your target library. Here you can refine object details, organize your projects, and keep your database clean.

**Filtering Your Library**

If you have a large library, use the filter bar at the top to find specific targets quickly. You can filter by:

* **ID or Name:** (e.g., "M42" or "Orion")
* **Constellation or Type:** (e.g., "Cyg" or "Nebula")
* **Status:** Filter by **Enabled** or **Disabled** objects, or see which items are **Shared** or **Imported**.
* **Source:** Find objects from specific catalogs (e.g., "messier"). If you want to select specifically only one source, use "=messier".

**Disabling Objects (Performance)**

To keep the Nova App running fast, you can **Disable** objects that you aren't currently imaging but don't want to delete.

* **Why Disable?** Disabled objects are skipped during heavy calculations (like the Dashboard and Outlook), significantly increasing software performance.
* **Journal Safe:** You can safely disable an object without losing data. Your existing **Journal** entries and logs for that object will remain fully functional and visible.
* **How to:** You can toggle the **Enabled/Disabled** status on a single object, or use the **Selection Actions** bar at the top to Enable or Disable many objects at once.

**Editing Object Data**

You can edit most fields directly in the list without leaving the page:

* **Coordinates & Stats:** Updates to RA/DEC, Magnitude, Size, or Surface Brightness are useful if you want to refine position accuracy or add missing data.
* **Active Project:** Check this box to mark the object as a priority. "Active" objects get special highlighting in the **Outlook** forecast tool.

**Notes & Sharing**

* **Private Notes:** Use this space for personal framing ideas, exposure plans, or reminders. These are never shared.
* **Shared Notes:** If you check **"Share this object,"** these notes will be visible to other users on the server.

**Saving Changes**

* **Single Update:** Click the **Update** button inside an object's box to save changes for just that target.
* **Bulk Update:** Click the large **Update Objects** button at the very bottom to save changes across the entire list.
* **Deleting:** Check the **Del** box (or use the Bulk Delete button) to remove an object permanently.
