### Locations Configuration

The **Locations** tab is where you define your observing sites. Whether it’s your backyard, a dark sky site, or a remote observatory, adding them here allows the **Nova App** to calculate accurate rise, set, and transit times for your specific position.

#### Adding a New Location
To add a site, fill in the fields at the top of the page:

  * **Name:** A friendly name for the site (e.g., "Home", "Desert Site").
  * **Lat / Lon:** Your latitude and longitude in decimal degrees.
  * **Timezone:** Select the correct timezone to ensure your graph times match your local clock.
  * **Active:** Check this to make the location available for selection in the main dashboard.

#### Managing Locations
You can edit existing locations directly in the list below the "Add" block.

  * **Update Details:** Change coordinates or timezones anytime. Remember to click **Update Locations** at the bottom to save changes.
  * **Active Status:** You can toggle locations on or off.
    * *Note: There is a limit of **5 active locations**.*
    * **Important:** If you stop using a site, **uncheck "Active" instead of deleting it**. Inactive locations are still available for your historical **Journal** entries, ensuring your past records remain accurate.
  * **Delete:** Check the **Del** box and click **Update Locations** to permanently remove a site. *Warning: This removes the location entirely.*

#### Horizon Mask
This optional field allows you to define obstructions (like trees or buildings) to prevent the app from suggesting targets hidden behind them.

  * **For details on how to format your mask coordinates**, please click the small **[?]** help badge next to the "Horizon Mask" label.
