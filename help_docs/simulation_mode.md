# Simulation Mode

Simulation Mode allows you to plan imaging sessions for future dates. Instead of showing the sky as it is "now" (real-time), the dashboard calculates object positions, moon phases, and darkness times for the date you select.

### How to Use
1.  **Toggle the Switch:** Click the toggle switch in the status bar to enable Simulation Mode.
2.  **Select a Date:** Click the date input field to choose your target planning date.

### What Changes?
* **Calculations:** Altitudes, azimuths, and transit times are recalculated for the simulated night.
* **Visual Indicators:** The status bar background turns **red** and a "Simulated" badge appears next to the Dashboard title to remind you that data is not real-time.
* **Graphs:** Altitude charts will show the curve for the selected night.
* **Inspiration:** The mini-graphs in the Inspiration modal will also reflect the simulated date.

### Important Notes
* **Time of Day:** The simulation preserves your current wall-clock *time of day*. If it is 2:00 PM now, the dashboard shows positions for 2:00 PM on the simulated date.
* **Cache:** Switching dates automatically refreshes the calculation cache for that specific date.
