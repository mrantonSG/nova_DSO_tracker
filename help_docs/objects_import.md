#### Import from Catalog

This tab allows you to bulk-import curated collections of objects provided by the server. This is the fastest way to populate a new library.

**Catalog Packs**

The table displays available "Packs" (e.g., "Messier Objects", "Caldwell Catalog", "Sharpless Catalog"). Each entry shows:

* **Name & Description:** What the pack contains.
* **Tags:** Quick categories (e.g., "Nebula", "Beginner").
* **Count:** How many objects are in the pack.

**How Import Works**

Click the **Import** button next to a pack to begin.

* **Non-Destructive:** The import process is safe. If you already have an object with the same name (e.g., you already added "M42"), Nova will **skip** it to preserve your custom notes and coordinates.
* **New Objects Only:** Only objects you do not currently have will be added to your database.
