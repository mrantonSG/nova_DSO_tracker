#### Import from Catalog

This tab allows you to bulk-import curated collections of objects provided by the server. This is the fastest way to populate a new library.

**Catalog Packs**

The table displays available "Packs" (e.g., "Messier Objects", "Caldwell Catalog", "Sharpless Catalog"). Each entry shows:

* **Name & Description:** What the pack contains.
* **Tags:** Quick categories (e.g., "Nebula", "Beginner").
* **Count:** How many objects are in the pack.

**How Import Works**

Click the **Import** button next to a pack to begin.

* **New Objects:** Objects you do not currently have will be added to your library.
* **Existing Objects (Updates):** If you already have an object (e.g., "M42"), Nova will **update** its "Inspiration" fields (Image URL, Description, Credits) with the high-quality data from the catalog.
* **Safe for Custom Data:** Your personal Project Notes, Active Status, and Saved Framings are **never overwritten**. The import only enhances the static catalog data.
