### Nova DSO Tracker v3.6.4 Release Notes

This update focuses on quality-of-life improvements, bug fixes, and enhanced usability across the application. While not a major feature release, version 3.6.4 brings a collection of valuable refinements for a smoother and more reliable experience.

#### Key Improvements & Fixes

* **Improved Weather Forecast Display:** The 7Timer! weather forecast has been moved from an overlay on the chart to a dedicated space *above* the chart area. This separation prevents the forecast from obscuring the altitude curves, resulting in a cleaner and more readable graph.

* **More Robust Configuration Management:** The handling of user configuration, journal, and rig `.yaml` files has been significantly hardened. This makes saving and loading your data more resilient, reducing the risk of data loss and improving overall stability.

* **Smarter Stellarium Integration:** The "Open in Stellarium" button is now more intelligent. The application will check if it can reach Stellarium *before* displaying the button, preventing you from clicking a button that won't work.

* **UI and Workflow Enhancements:**
    * **Rigs:** In configuration, the default seeing is now pre-selected to "Good".
    * **Journal:** Various small user interface tweaks have been implemented in the Journal section to improve the user experience.

* **Bug Fix:** An issue where the "Find Imaging Opportunities" feature could sometimes get stuck in an endless "Searching..." state has been resolved. The search now completes reliably.

Thank you for your continued feedback. We hope these small but meaningful updates improve your planning and tracking workflow.
