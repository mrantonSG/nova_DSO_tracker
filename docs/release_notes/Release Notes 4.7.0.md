# Nova DSO Tracker v4.7.0

Hi everyone! I am really excited to get v4.7.0 out the door. It has been a busy few weeks in my free time, but I think these changes will make a big difference in how the app feels and performs.

# Interface Updates

The most obvious change you will see is a redesign of the header area above the main tabs to clean up the layout. I also updated the styling so the currently selected tab is physically larger, making it much easier to see where you are at a glance.

# Feature Enhancements

I have added a small 'i' icon next to object names that lets you quickly pop open the inspiration modal, which now includes the altitude graph for that target. The main graph screen now displays angular separation data to help you better plan around the moon. Additionally, the app now automatically skips calculations for objects that are geometrically impossible to see from your location and hides them to keep your lists clutter-free.

# Improvements & Safeguards

I tweaked the behavior of the text boxes in the object list to significantly improve loading speeds. I also added a safety check that prevents you from deleting objects that are already linked to a journal session, just to keep your data safe.

Thanks again for all your patience and feedback, it really keeps this project going.
