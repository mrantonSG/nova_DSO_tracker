## Release 4.0.5 - Hotfix

This is a quick follow-up to our release yesterday to fix a high-priority bug.

* **What's Fixed:**
    * I've resolved an issue on the "Framing & Notes" tab where your Project Notes were loading outside of the editor box. This was a visual bug and no data was lost.
    * The notes editor now loads and displays all your rich text content correctly, just as it does in the config menu.

Thank you for your patience as we get this fix out to you!
