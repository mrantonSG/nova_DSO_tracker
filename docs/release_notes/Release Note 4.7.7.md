# Nova DSO Tracker v4.7.7

Hi everyone,

This is a minor update with a few quality-of-life improvements and important bug fixes.

### Improvements

*   **UI Tweak:** The "Active Projects Only" checkbox on the Yearly Heatmap has been moved above the main tabs for easier access and better visibility.

### Bug Fixes

*   **Mini-Charts:** Fixed an issue where the mini-charts on the main dashboard were not displaying correctly for all objects, ensuring they now load reliably.
*   **Version Display:** Corrected a bug that could cause an incorrect version number to be displayed, ensuring users always see the accurate version.

Thanks for your continued feedback!
