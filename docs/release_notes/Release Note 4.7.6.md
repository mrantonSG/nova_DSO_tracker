# Nova DSO Tracker v4.7.6

Hi everyone! Really sorry for the double update today—this is just a quick hotfix.

# Security Update

Right after pushing the last release, GitHub flagged a security vulnerability in one of the underlying libraries we use. To keep everyone's installation secure, I have updated `urllib3` to version 2.6.3.

That is the only change in this version. Better safe than sorry! Thanks for bearing with me.
