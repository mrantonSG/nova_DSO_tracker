# Nova DSO Tracker v4.5.0

Hey everyone! Thanks so much for sticking with the project and for all the feedback you've been sending my way. Version 4.5.0 is finally ready, and it focuses heavily on making the Journal easier to use based on what you've been asking for.

# New Features

* **Journal Data & Workflow:** I know entering data can be repetitive, so I've added a feature to duplicate existing journal sessions to speed things up. I also added a CSV download option for sessions and projects, so you can easily export your data for your own records.
* **In-App Help:** To make the tool a bit friendlier for newcomers, I've added help badges and tooltips across the configuration and main pages.

# Bug Fixes

* **Journal Project Framing:** Fixed an issue where uploading pictures for project framing wasn't working as expected.
* **Adding Projects:** We realized not all fields were showing up when adding a new project directly from the journal, so those missing fields are now available.
* **Notes Editor:** Squashed a bug related to file imports within the Trix editor in the journal section.

Thanks again for all your patience and feedback, it really keeps this project going during my free time.
