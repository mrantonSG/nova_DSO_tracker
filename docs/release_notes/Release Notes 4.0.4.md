## Release v4.0.4

This is a patch release that fixes a key bug in the Framing Assistant and adds a helpful new counter to the object management list.

###  Improvements

* **Object List Counter:** The "Manage My Objects" tab now features a live-updating counter. This displays the total number of objects in your library and how many are currently visible based on your active filters (e.g., "Showing 12 of 150 objects").

###  Bug Fixes

* **Fixed Framing Assistant Sliders:** Fixed a bug in the Framing Assistant where the brightness, contrast, saturation, and gamma sliders had no effect when a "Blend with:" layer was active. The sliders will now correctly adjust both the base survey and the active blend layer simultaneously.
