# Nova DSO Tracker v4.7.5

Hi everyone! I decided to hold off a few days to bundle some extra improvements into this release. I made a slightly bigger jump in version numbers to v4.7.5 because, alongside some nice fixes, I have added a brand new feature for us to test out.

# New Features

**Log File Import (Beta)**
I have added the ability to import and display log files from both ASIAIR and PHD2. This is still in the testing phase, but it should allow you to pull actual session data—like guiding performance and exposure stats—directly into your journal entries without manual typing. I would love to hear how it handles your specific files!

**NSNS V2 Support**
The Framing Assistant now includes the new Northern Sky Narrowband Survey (V2). This survey is amazing for planning narrowband targets. Don't worry about your existing data—any old framings you saved will still work perfectly fine.

# Improvements & Fixes

* **Project Reports:** I fixed an issue where framing data wasn't showing up in the project reports, so your PDF exports should be more complete now.
* **Journal Layout:** I improved the formatting of projects on the journal page to make browsing your history a bit cleaner.

Thanks again for all your patience and feedback, it really keeps this project going.
