## Release v4.0.7

This is a patch release that fixes some bugs in the Journal and changes the layout for a better user experience.

###  Improvements

* **Notes & Framing:** Order of the tabs has changed to follow a more logic workflow. Inside the tab notes now are on the top, the framing with the rigs at the bottom.
* **Deactivated Locations:** To reduce the workload of the server, the number of active locations is limited to 5. However, with this version all locations are still accessible for journals.

###  Bug Fixes

* **Update of Journal:** Fixed a bug that prevented the project assignment of a session to be updated.
* **Yaml file sharing:** Yaml files (config, rig, journal) can now again be shared between single and mult user installations. So you can download your yamls from a server (e.g. app.nova-tracker.com) and import them into you local single user installation.
