    discovered in 1955 by University of California, Los Angeles astronomer George
    O. Abell, who classified it as an old planetary nebula. With the computation of
    expansion velocities and the thermal character of the radio emission, Soviet astronomers
    in 1971 concluded that it was most likely a planetary nebula. As the nebula is
    so large, its surface brightness is very low, with surface magnitudes of between
    +15.99 and +25 reported.

    The central star of the planetary nebula is a PG 1159 star.'

  description_text: 'The Heart Nebula (also known as the Running Dog Nebula, Sharpless
    2-190) is an emission nebula, 7,500 light-years (2,300 pc) away from Earth and
    located in the Perseus Arm of the Galaxy in the constellation Cassiopeia. It was
    discovered by William Herschel on 3 November 1787. In 1958, it was identified
    as a radio source by Gart Westerhout and is therefore also referred to as Westerhout
    4 (or W4) .

    It displays glowing ionized hydrogen gas and darker dust lanes.

    The brightest part of the nebula (a knot at its western edge) is separately classified
    as NGC 896, because it was the first part of the nebula to be discovered. The
    nebula''s intense red output and its morphology are driven by the radiation emanating
    from a small group of hot stars near the nebula''s center. This open cluster of
    stars, known as Collinder 26, Melotte 15, or IC 1805, contains a few bright stars
    nearly 50 times the mass of the Sun, and many more dim stars that are only a fraction
    of the Solar mass.

    The Heart Nebula is also made up of ionized oxygen and sulfur gasses, which are
    responsible for the rich blue and orange colors seen in narrowband images. The
    nebula also spans almost 2 degrees in the sky, covering an area four times that
    of the diameter of the full moon.

    The Heart Nebula belongs to a larger structure known as the W3/W4/W5 complex.
    It is also the brightest part of a superbubble known as the W4 superbubble , sometimes
    referred to as the W4 chimney, as it is believed that hot gas is transferred from
    the galactic disk to the halo through this structure.'

  description_text: 'IC 2118 (also known as Witch Head Nebula due to its shape) is
    an extremely faint reflection nebula believed to be an ancient supernova remnant
    or gas cloud illuminated by nearby supergiant star Rigel in the constellation
    of Orion. The nebula lies in the Eridanus Constellation, about 900 light-years
    from Earth. The nature of the dust particles, reflecting blue light better than
    red, is a factor in giving the Witch Head its blue color. Radio observations show
    substantial carbon monoxide emission throughout parts of IC 2118, an indicator
    of the presence of molecular clouds and star formation in the nebula. In fact
    candidates for pre-main sequence stars and some classic T Tauri stars have been
    found deep within the nebula.

    The molecular clouds of IC 2118 are probably juxtaposed to the outer boundaries
    of the vast Orion-Eridanus bubble, a giant supershell of molecular hydrogen blown
    by the high mass stars of the Orion OB1 association. As the supershell expands
    into the interstellar medium, favorable circumstances for star formation occur.
    IC 2118 is located in one such area. The wind blown appearance and cometary shape
    of the bright reflection nebula is highly suggestive of a strong association with
    the high mass luminous stars of Orion OB1. The fact that the heads of the cometary
    clouds of IC2118 point northeast towards the association is strong support of
    that relationship.'

    On the plane of the sky, it is located near the star Eta Geminorum.

    Its distance is roughly 5,000 light years from Earth.

    IC 443 may be the remains of a supernova that occurred 30,000 - 35,000 years ago.
    The same supernova event likely created the neutron star CXOU J061705.3+222127,
    the collapsed remnant of the stellar core. IC 443 is one of the best-studied cases
    of supernova remnants interacting with surrounding molecular clouds.

  description_text: 'IC 4665 (Collinder 349 / Melotte 179), also known as the Summer
    Beehive Cluster or Poseidon''s Trident , is an open cluster of stars in the constellation
    Ophiuchus, about 1° to the northeast of the star Beta Ophiuchi. It was discovered
    by Swiss astronomer Philippe Loys de Chéseaux in 1745. The cluster lies about
    1,100 light years away from Earth. It is easily visible in the smallest of telescopes
    and also with binoculars. From a sufficiently dark place it is also visible to
    the naked eye. It is one of the brightest clusters not to be cataloged by Charles
    Messier or William Herschel, probably because it is so loose and coarse.

    Age estimates for this cluster have ranged from 20 up to as high as 100 million
    years. Comparison of the stellar lithium depletion with other clusters suggests
    it began to develop about 55 million years ago. The upper main sequence turnoff
    age is 42±12 Myr. 819 candidate cluster members have been identified. Two chemically
    peculiar stars were found to be members in 1977. It has an estimated mass of about
    130 suns.

    There is evidence that IC 4665 is undergoing a collision with the older cluster
    Collinder 350, located about 4° away. Currently they are separated by a distance
    of 118.2 ly (36.25 pc), after having formed at least 1,600 ly (500 pc) apart.
    It is unclear whether the two clusters will merge as a result of the collision.'

  description_text: 'The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is a dwarf galaxy and satellite
    galaxy of the Milky Way. At a distance of around 50 kiloparsecs (163,000 light-years),
    the LMC is the second- or third-closest galaxy to the Milky Way, after the Sagittarius
    Dwarf Spheroidal (c. 16 kiloparsecs (52,000 light-years) away) and the possible
    dwarf irregular galaxy called the Canis Major Overdensity. It is about 9.86 kiloparsecs
    (32,200 light-years) across, and has roughly one-hundredth the mass of the Milky
    Way making it the fourth-largest galaxy in the Local Group, after the Andromeda
    Galaxy (M31), the Milky Way, and the Triangulum Galaxy (M33).

    The LMC is classified as a Magellanic spiral. It contains a stellar bar that is
    geometrically off-center, suggesting that it was once a barred dwarf spiral galaxy
    before its spiral arms were disrupted, likely by tidal interactions from the nearby
    Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and the Milky Way''s gravity. The LMC is predicted
    to merge with the Milky Way in approximately 2.4 billion years.

    With a declination of about −70°, the LMC is visible as a faint "cloud" from the
    Southern Hemisphere of the Earth and from as far north as 20° N. It straddles
    the constellations Dorado and Mensa and has an apparent length of about 10° to
    the naked eye, 20 times the Moon''s diameter, from dark sites away from light

  description_text: 'The Crab Nebula (catalogue designations M1, NGC 1952, Taurus
    A) is a supernova remnant and pulsar wind nebula in the constellation of Taurus.
    The common name comes from a drawing that somewhat resembled a crab with arms
    produced by William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, in 1842 or 1843 using a 36-inch
    (91 cm) telescope. The nebula was discovered by English astronomer John Bevis
    in 1731. It corresponds with a bright supernova observed in 1054 C.E. by Mayan,
    Japanese, and Arab stargazers; this supernova was also recorded by Chinese astronomers
    as a guest star. The nebula was the first astronomical object identified that
    corresponds with a historically-observed supernova explosion.

    At an apparent magnitude of 8.4, comparable to that of Saturn''s moon Titan, it
    is not visible to the naked eye but can be made out using binoculars under favourable
    conditions. The nebula lies in the Perseus Arm of the Milky Way galaxy, at a distance
    of about 2.0 kiloparsecs (6,500 ly) from Earth. It has a diameter of 3.4 parsecs
    (11 ly), corresponding to an apparent diameter of some 7 arcminutes, and is expanding
    at a rate of about 1,500 kilometres per second (930 mi/s), or 0.5% of the speed
    of light.

    The Crab Pulsar, a neutron star 28–30 kilometres (17–19 mi) across with a spin
    rate of 30.2 times per second, lies at the center of the Crab Nebula. The star
    emits pulses of radiation from gamma rays to radio waves. At X-ray and gamma ray
    energies above 30 keV, the Crab Nebula is generally the brightest persistent gamma-ray
    source in the sky, with measured flux extending to above 10 TeV. The nebula''s
    radiation allows detailed study of celestial bodies that occult it. In the 1950s
    and 1960s, the Sun''s corona was mapped from observations of the Crab Nebula''s
    radio waves passing through it, and in 2003, the thickness of the atmosphere of
    Saturn''s moon Titan was measured as it blocked out X-rays from the nebula.

  description_text: 'Messier 10 or M10 (also designated NGC 6254) is a globular cluster
    of stars in the equatorial constellation of Ophiuchus. The object was discovered
    by the French astronomer Charles Messier on May 29, 1764, who cataloged it as
    number 10 in his catalogue and described it as a "nebula without stars". In 1774,
    German astronomer Johann Elert Bode likewise called it a "nebulous patch without
    stars; very pale". Using larger instrumentation, German-born astronomer William
    Herschel was able to resolve the cluster into its individual members. He described
    it as a "beautiful cluster of extremely compressed stars". William Parsons, 3rd
    Earl of Rosse thought he could distinguish a dark lane through part of the cluster.
    The first to estimate the distance to the cluster was Harlow Shapley, although
    his derivation of 33,000 light years was much further than the modern value.

    The tidal radius of M10 is 19.3 arcminutes, which is about two-thirds of the apparent
    diameter of the Moon. Viewed through medium-sized telescopes it appears about
    half that size (8–9 arcminutes), as its bright core is only 35 light-years across.
    It has a core radius of 48 arcseconds and a half-mass radius of 147 arcseconds
    (2.5 arcminutes). M10 has a spatial diameter of 83 light-years and is estimated
    to be 14,300 light-years away from Earth. It figures a degree west of 30 Ophiuchi,
    a center-of-constellation orange star.

    In terms of the abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomers
    term the metallicity, Messier 10 is "moderately metal–poor". The abundance of
    iron, measured as [Fe/H] equals –1.45 ± 0.04 dex, is only 3.5% of the abundance
    found at the surface of the Sun. The cluster shows evidence of being enriched
    by the elements generated through the s-process in massive stars and Type II supernovae.
    It shows little evidence of enrichment by Type Ia supernovae.

    Because binary stars are, on average, more massive than normal stars, the binaries
    tend to migrate toward the center of the cluster. The fraction of binary stars
    in the core region is about 14%. This proportion decreases with increasing radius
    to about 1.5% in the outlying regions of the cluster. Correspondingly, the core
    region contains a concentration of interaction-formed blue straggler stars, most
    of which formed 2–5 billion years ago. The density of stars in the core region
    is about 3.8 solar masses per cubic parsec. Four variable stars have been discovered
    in this cluster.

    The cluster is currently located about 5 kiloparsecs (16 kly) from the Galactic
    Center. It completes an orbit around the Milky Way galaxy about every 140 million
    years, during which it crosses the plane of the galactic disk every 53 million
    years. Its rosette orbit has an eccentricity of 0.21.'

  description_text: 'The Wild Duck Cluster (also known as Messier 11, or NGC 6705)
    is an open cluster of stars in the constellation Scutum (the Shield). It was discovered
    by Gottfried Kirch in 1681. Charles Messier included it in his catalogue of diffuse
    objects in 1764. Its popular name derives from the brighter stars forming a triangle
    which could resemble a flying flock of ducks (or, from other angles, one swimming
    duck). The cluster is located just to the east of the Scutum Star Cloud midpoint.

    The Wild Duck Cluster is one of the richest and most compact of the known open
    clusters. It is one of the most massive open clusters known, and it has been extensively
    studied. Its age has been estimated to about 316 million years. The core radius
    is 1.23 pc (4.0 ly) while the tidal radius is 29 pc (95 ly). Estimates for the
    cluster''s mass range from 3,700 M☉ to 11,000 M☉, depending on the method chosen.
    The brightest cluster member is visual magnitude 8, and it has 870 members of
    at least magnitude 16.5. It has an integrated absolute magnitude of –6.5, and
    a visual extinction of 1.3.

    The cluster is metal-rich with an iron abundance of [Fe/H] = 0.17±0.04. Despite
    its youth, it shows an enhancement of alpha process elements. Possibly this is
    due to an enhancement of its birth molecular cloud by a nearby Type II supernova
    explosion. At least nine variable star members have been identified with high
    probability, plus 29 lower probability members. The former include two eclipsing
    binary star systems. The cluster is located 6.8 kpc (22,000 ly) from the Galactic
    Center, close to the galactic plane, and is not far from its birthplace.'

  description_text: 'Messier 12 or M 12 (also designated NGC 6218) is a globular cluster
    in the constellation of Ophiuchus. It was discovered by the French astronomer
    Charles Messier on May 30, 1764, who described it as a "nebula without stars".
    In dark conditions this cluster can be faintly seen with a pair of binoculars.
    Resolving the stellar components requires a telescope with an aperture of 8 in
    (20 cm) or greater. In a 10 in (25 cm) scope, the granular core shows a diameter
    of 3′ (arcminutes) surrounded by a 10′ halo of stars.

    M12 is roughly 3° northwest from the cluster M10 and 5.6° east southeast from
    star Lambda Ophiuchi. It is also located near the 6th magnitude 12 Ophiuchi. The
    cluster is about 16,400 light-years (5,000 parsecs) from Earth and has a spatial
    diameter of about 75 light-years. The brightest stars of M12 are of 12th magnitude.
    M10 and M12 are only a few thousand light-years away from each other and each
    cluster would appear at about magnitude 4.5 from the other. With a Shapley-Sawyer
    rating of IX, it is rather loosely packed for a globular and was once thought
    to be a tightly concentrated open cluster. Thirteen variable stars have been recorded
    in this cluster. M12 is approaching us at a velocity of 16 km/s.

    A study published in 2006 concluded that this cluster has an unusually low number
    of low-mass stars. The authors surmise that they were stripped from the cluster
    by passage through the relatively matter-rich plane of the Milky Way.'

    M14 is about 100 light-years across.

    A total of 70 variable stars are known in M14, many of the W Virginis variety
    common in globular clusters. In 1938, a nova appeared, although this was not discovered
    until photographic plates from that time were studied in 1964. It is estimated

    objects. From the perspective of Earth, M18 is situated between the Omega Nebula
    (M17) and the Small Sagittarius Star Cloud (M24).

    This is a sparse cluster with a linear diameter of 8.04 pc, a tidal radius of
    7.3 pc, and is centrally concentrated with core radius of 0.012 pc. It has a Trumpler
    class of II 3 p. The cluster is 33 million years old with an estimated mass of

    in the constellation Ophiuchus. It was discovered by Charles Messier on June 5,
    1764 and added to his catalogue of comet-like objects that same year. It was resolved
    into individual stars by William Herschel in 1784. His son, John Herschel, described
    it as "a superb cluster resolvable into countless stars". The cluster is located
    4.5° WSW of Theta Ophiuchi and is just visible as a fuzzy point of light using
    50 mm (2.0 in) binoculars. Using a telescope with a 25.4 cm (10.0 in) aperture,
    the cluster shows an oval appearance with a 3′ × 4′ core and a 5′ × 7′ halo.

    M19 is one of the most oblate of the known globular clusters. This flattening
    may not accurately reflect the physical shape of the cluster because the emitted
    light is being strongly absorbed along the eastern edge. This is the result of
    extinction caused by intervening gas and dust. When viewed in the infrared, the
    cluster shows almost no flattening. It lies at a distance of about 28.7 kly (8.8
    kpc) from the Solar System, and is quite near to the Galactic Center at only about
    6.5 kly (2.0 kpc) away.

    This cluster contains an estimated 1,100,000 times the mass of the Sun and it
    is around 11.9 billion years old. The stellar population includes four Cepheids
    and RV Tauri variables, plus at least one RR Lyrae variable for which a period
    is known. Observations made during the ROSAT mission failed to reveal any low-intensity

  description_text: 'Messier 22 or M22, also known as NGC 6656 or the Great Sagittarius
    Cluster, is an elliptical globular cluster of stars in the constellation Sagittarius,
    near the Galactic bulge region. It is one of the brightest globulars visible in
    the night sky. The brightest stars are 11th magnitude, with hundreds of stars
    bright enough to resolve with an 8" telescope. It is just south of the sun''s
    position in mid-December, and northeast of Lambda Sagittarii (Kaus Borealis),
    the northernmost star of the "Teapot" asterism.

    M22 was one of the first globulars to be discovered, in 1665 by Abraham Ihle and
    it was included in Charles Messier''s catalog of comet-like objects in 1764. It
    was one of the first globular clusters to be carefully studied – first by Harlow
    Shapley in 1930. He placed within it roughly 70,000 stars and found it had a dense
    core. Then Halton Arp and William G. Melbourne continued studies in 1959. Due
    to the large color spread of its red giant branch (RGB) sequence, akin to that
    in Omega Centauri, it became the object of intense scrutiny starting in 1977 with
    James E. Hesser et al.

    M22 is one of the nearer globular clusters to Earth – at about 10,600 light-years
    away. It spans 32′ on the sky which means its diameter (width across) is 99 ±
    9 light-years, given its estimated distance. 32 variable stars have been recorded
    in M22.  It is in front of part of the galactic bulge and is therefore useful
    for its microlensing effect on those background stars.

    Despite its relative proximity to us, this metal-poor cluster''s light is limited
    by dust extinction, giving it an apparent magnitude of 5.5; even so, it is the
    brightest globular cluster visible from mid-northern latitudes (such as Japan,
    Korea, Europe and most of North America). From those latitudes due to its declination
    of nearly 24° south of the (celestial) equator, its daily path is low in the southern
    sky. It thus appears less impressive to people in the temperate northern hemisphere
    than counterparts fairly near in angle (best viewed in the Summer night sky) such
    as M13 and M5.

    M22 is one of only four globulars of our galaxy known to contain a planetary nebula
    (an expanding, glowing gas swell from a massive star, often a red giant). It was
    an object first noted of interest using the IRAS satellite by Fred Gillett and
    his associates in 1986, as a pointlike light source and its nature was found in
    1989 by Gillett et al. The planetary nebula''s central star is a blue star.  The
    nebula, designated GJJC1, is likely about only 6,000 years old.

    Two black holes of between 10 and 20 solar masses (M☉) each were unearthed with
    the Very Large Array radio telescope in New Mexico and corroborated by the Chandra
    X-ray telescope in 2012. These imply that gravitational ejection of black holes
    from clusters is not as efficient as was previously thought, and leads to estimates
    of a total 5 to 100 black holes within M22. Interactions between stars and black
    holes could explain the unusually large core of the cluster.'

    in the northwest of the southern constellation of Sagittarius. It was discovered
    by Charles Messier in 1764. It can be found in good conditions with binoculars
    or a modestly sized telescope. It is in front of "an extensive gas and dust network",
    which there may be no inter-association. It is within 5° the sun''s position (namely
    in mid-December) so can be occulted by the moon.

    The cluster is centered about 2,050 light years away. Estimates for the number
    of its members range from 169 up to 414, with a directly-counted mass of 1,206
    M☉; 1,332 M☉ by application of the virial theorem. The cluster is around 330 million
    years old with a near-solar metallicity of [Fe/H] = −0.04. The brightest component
    (lucida) is of magnitude 9.3. Five of the cluster members are candidate red giants,

  description_text: 'The Small Sagittarius Star Cloud (also known as Messier 24 and
    IC 4715) is a star cloud in the constellation of Sagittarius approximately 600
    light years wide, which was catalogued by Charles Messier in 1764. It should not
    be confused with the nearby Large Sagittarius Star Cloud which lies about 10°
    to the south.

    Messier described the cloud as "a large nebulosity in which there are many stars
    of different magnitudes" and gave its dimensions as being some 1.5° across. Some
    sources, improperly, identify M24 as the small open cluster NGC 6603. The location
    of the Small Sagittarius Star Cloud is near the Omega Nebula (also known as M17)
    and open cluster Messier 18, both north of M24.

    Messier 24 is not a distinct deep-sky object, rather an open window through the
    Great Rift into deeper regions of the Milky Way galaxy.  It fills a space of significant
    volume to a depth of 10,000 to 15,000 light years away, including stars from the
    Scutum-Centaurus Arm, the major spiral arm between Earth and the Galactic Center.
    The star cloud is the most dense concentration of individual stars visible using
    binoculars, with around 1,000 stars visible within a single field of view. In
    telescopes it is best seen at low magnification, with a field of view of at least
    2 degrees. Described as "a virtual carpet of stellar jewels", M24 is visible to
    the naked eye whenever the Milky Way itself is visible as well.

    The light of M24 is spread out over a large area, which makes estimating its brightness
    difficult. Older references give the star cloud''s magnitude as 4.6, but more
    recent estimates place it a full two magnitudes brighter, at 2.5.

    HD 167356 is the brightest star within the Small Sagittarius Star Cloud, a white
    supergiant with an apparent magnitude of 6.05. This star is an Alpha-2 Canum Venaticorum
    variable, showing small changes in brightness as it rotates. There are three other
    stars in M24 with visual magnitudes between 6.5 and 7.0.

    The star cloud incorporates two prominent dark nebulae which are vast clouds of
    dense, obscuring interstellar dust. This dust blocks light from the more distant
    stars, which keeps them from being seen from Earth. Lying on the northwestern
    side is Barnard 92, which is the darker of the two. Within the star field, the
    nebula appears as an immense round hole devoid of stars. American astronomer Edward
    Emerson Barnard discovered this dark nebula in 1913. Along the northeast side
    lies Barnard 93, as large as Barnard 92 though less obvious. There are also other
    dark nebulae within M24, including Barnard 304 and Barnard 307.

    The Small Sagittarius Star Cloud also contains two planetary nebulae, M 1-43 and
    NGC 6567. Messier 24 holds some similarities with NGC 206, a bright, large star
    cloud within the Andromeda Galaxy.'

    years. It includes one known spectroscopic binary system.

    An interesting feature of M26 is a region of low star density near the nucleus.
    A hypothesis was that it was caused by an obscuring cloud of interstellar matter
    between us and the cluster, but a paper by James Cuffey suggested that this is

  description_text: 'The Dumbbell Nebula (also known as the Apple Core Nebula, Messier
    27, and NGC 6853) is a planetary nebula (nebulosity surrounding a white dwarf)
    in the constellation Vulpecula, at a distance of about 1360 light-years. It was
    the first such nebula to be discovered, by Charles Messier in 1764. At its brightness
    of visual magnitude 7.5 and diameter of about 8 arcminutes, it is easily visible
    in binoculars and is a popular observing target in amateur telescopes.

    The Dumbbell Nebula appears shaped like a prolate spheroid and is viewed from
    our perspective along the plane of its equator. In 1992, Moreno-Corral et al.
    computed that its rate of expansion angularly was, viewed from our distance, no
    more than 2.3 arcseconds (″) per century. From this, an upper limit to the age
    of 14,600 years may be determined. In 1970, Bohuski, Smith, and Weedman found
    an expansion velocity of 31 km/s. Given its semi-minor axis radius of 1.01 ly,
    this implies that the kinematic age of the nebula is 9,800 years.

    Like many nearby planetary nebulae, the Dumbbell contains knots. Its central region
    is marked by a pattern of dark and bright cusped knots and their associated dark
    tails (see picture). The knots vary in appearance from symmetric objects with
    tails to rather irregular tail-less objects. Similarly to the Helix Nebula and
    the Eskimo Nebula, the heads of the knots have bright cusps which are local photoionization
    fronts.

    The central star, a white dwarf progenitor, is estimated to have a radius which
    is 0.055±0.02 R☉ (0.13 light seconds) which gives it a size larger than most other
    known white dwarfs. Its mass was estimated in 1999 by Napiwotzki to be 0.56±0.01
    M☉.'

    mass for the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy has a diameter of about 46.56 kpc
    (152,000 ly), making it the largest member of the Local Group of galaxies in terms
    of extension.

    The Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies have about a 50% chance of colliding with
    each other in the next 10 billion years, merging to potentially form a giant elliptical
    galaxy or a large lenticular galaxy.

    With an apparent magnitude of 3.4, the Andromeda Galaxy is among the brightest
    of the Messier objects, and is visible to the naked eye from Earth on moonless
    nights, even when viewed from areas with moderate light pollution.'

  description_text: 'Messier 34 (also known as M34, NGC 1039, or the Spiral Cluster)
    is a large and relatively near open cluster in Perseus. It was probably discovered
    by Giovanni Batista Hodierna before 1654 and included by Charles Messier in his
    catalog of comet-like objects in 1764. Messier described it as, "A cluster of
    small stars a little below the parallel of γ (Andromedae). In an ordinary telescope
    of 3 feet one can distinguish the stars."

    Based on the distance modulus of 8.38, it is about 470 parsecs (1,500 ly) away.
    For stars ranging from 0.12 to 1 solar mass (M☉), the cluster has about 400. It
    spans about 35′ on the sky which translates to a true radius of 7.5 light years
    at such distance. The cluster is just visible to the naked eye in very dark conditions,
    well away from city lights. It is possible to see it in binoculars when light
    pollution is low.

    The age of this cluster lies between the ages of the Pleiades open cluster at
    100 million years and the Hyades open cluster at 800 million years. Specifically,
    comparison between noted stellar spectra and the values predicted by stellar evolutionary
    models suggest 200–250 million years. This is roughly the age at which stars with
    half a solar mass enter the main sequence. By comparison, stars like the Sun enter
    the main sequence after 30 million years.

    The average proportion of elements with higher atomic numbers than helium is termed
    the metallicity by astronomers. This is expressed by the logarithm of the ratio
    of iron to hydrogen, compared to the same proportion in the Sun. For M34, the
    metallicity has a value of [Fe/H] = +0.07 ± 0.04. This is equivalent to a 17%
    higher proportion of iron compared to the Sun. Other elements show a similar abundance,
    save for nickel which is underabundant.

    At least 19 members are white dwarfs. These are stellar remnants of progenitor
    stars of up to eight solar masses (M☉) that have evolved through the main sequence
    and are no longer have thermonuclear fusion to generate energy. Seventeen of these
    are of spectral type DA or DAZ, while one is a type DB and the last is a type
    DC.'

    Cluster, is a relatively close open cluster of stars in the west of Gemini, at
    about the declination of the Sun when the latter is at June solstice. It was discovered
    by Philippe Loys de Chéseaux around 1745 and independently discovered by John
    Bevis before 1750. It is scattered over part of the sky almost the size of the
    full moon and is 2,970 light-years (912 parsecs) away. The compact open cluster
    NGC 2158 lies directly southwest of it.

    Leonard & Merritt (1989) computed the mass of M35 using a statistical technique
    based on proper motion velocities of its stars. The mass within the central 3.75
    parsecs (12.2 ly) was found to be between 1600 and 3200 solar masses, consistent
    with the mass of a realistic stellar population within the same radius. Bouy et
    al. in 2015 found a mass of around 1,600 M☉ within the central 27.5'' × 27.5′.
    There are 305 stars that can be intrinsically shown to be extremely likely to
    be members, and up to 4,349 averaging the 50% membership probability, from the
    kinematic (such as parallax and proper motion) and spectral data published before
    2015. The cluster''s metallicity is [Fe/H] = −0.21±0.10, where −1 would be ten
    times less metallic than the sun.

    Of 418 probable members, Leiner et al. in 2015 found 64 that have variable radial
    velocities thus are binary star systems. Four probable members are chemically
    peculiars, while HD 41995, which in the (telescopic angular) cluster field, shows
    emission lines. Hu et al. in 2005 found 13 variable stars in the field; at least
    three are suspect as cluster members. To be a member means to have a gravitational
    tie or, if recently freed, having been created by the same event.'

  description_text: 'Messier 36 or M36, also known as NGC 1960 or the Pinwheel Cluster,
    is an open cluster of stars in the somewhat northern Auriga constellation. It
    was discovered by Giovanni Batista Hodierna before 1654, who described it as a
    nebulous patch. The cluster was independently re-discovered by Guillaume Le Gentil
    in 1749, then Charles Messier observed it in 1764 and added it to his catalogue.
    It is about 1,330 pc (4,340 light years) away from Earth. The cluster is very
    similar to the Pleiades cluster (M45), and if as far away it would be of similar
    apparent magnitude.

    This cluster has an angular diameter of 10′ and a core radius of 3.2′. It has
    a mass of roughly 746 M☉ and a linear tidal radius of 10.6 ± 1.6 parsecs (34.6
    ± 5.2 ly). Based upon photometry, the age of the cluster has been estimated by
    Wu et al. (2009) as 25.1 Myr and 26.3+3.2−5.2 Myr by Bell et al. (2013). The luminosity
    of the stars that have not yet depleted their lithium implies an age of 22±4 Myr,
    in good agreement with these older estimates.

    M36 includes ten stars with a visual magnitude brighter than 10, and 178 down
    to magnitude 14. 38 members display an infrared excess, with one being particularly
    high. There is one candidate B-type variable star, of 9th magnitude.

    A 2020 study of the variable stars in the cluster estimated a new closer distance
    of 3,800 light years from Earth.


    A young stellar object with an outflow, associated with the infrared source IRAS
    05327+3404 was discovered in optical observations of M36. The outflow is nicknamed
    "Holoea", Hawaiian for "flowing gas". Despite appearing close to M36 it is probably
    not a part of M36 .It may be a member of the more distant S235 region. The young
    star driving the outflow was classified as transitional between class I and class
    II and appears to be surrounded by large amounts of circumstellar material.

    double star consisting of two unrelated stars in a northerly zone of the sky,
    Ursa Major.

    The pair were discovered by Charles Messier in 1764 while he was searching for
    a nebula that had been reported in the area by Johannes Hevelius.  Not seeing
    any nebulae, Messier catalogued this apparent pair instead.  The pair were rediscovered
    by Friedrich August Theodor Winnecke in 1863, and included in the Winnecke Catalogue
    of Double Stars as number 4.  Burnham calls M40 "one of the few real mistakes
    in the Messier catalog," faulting Messier for including it when all he saw was
    a double star, not a nebula of any sort.

    In 1991 the separation between the components was measured at 51.7″, an increase
    since 1764.  Data gathered by astronomers Brian Skiff (2001) and Richard L. Nugent
    (2002) strongly suggested the subject was merely an optical double star rather
    than a physically connected (binary) system.  The A star that seems the brighter
    is over twice as far as B.  Parallax measurements from the Gaia satellite show
    the two stars, HD 238107 and HD 238108, are at distances of 311 ± 1 parsec (1,013

  description_text: 'Messier 43 or M43, also known as De Mairan''s Nebula and NGC
    1982, is a star-forming nebula with a prominent H II region in the equatorial
    constellation of Orion. It was discovered by the French scientist Jean-Jacques
    d''Ortous de Mairan some time before 1731, then catalogued by Charles Messier
    in 1769. It is physically part of the Orion Nebula (Messier 42), separate from
    that main nebula by a dense lane of dust known as the northeast dark lane. It
    is part of the much larger Orion molecular cloud complex.

    The main ionizing star in this nebula is the quadruple star system NU Orionis
    (HD 37061), the focus of the H II region, 1,360 ± 30 ly (417.0 ± 9.2 pc) away.

    The H II region is a roundish volume of ionized hydrogen. It has a diameter of
    about 4.5′, at its distance meaning it measures 2.1 ly (0.65 pc). The net (meaning
    omitting the star) hydrogen alpha luminosity of this region is (3.0±1.1)×1035
    erg s−1; equivalent to 78 L☉. There is a dark lane crossing the whole west-centre
    strip from north to south, known as the M43 dark lane, which forming a swirling
    belt extension to the south links to Orion''s northeast dark lane. All of these
    resemble a mixture of smoke rising from a chimney and in watercolour broad and
    fine dark brushstrokes, at many wavelengths.'

  description_text: 'The Pleiades ( PLEE-ə-deez, PLAY-, PLY-), also known as Seven
    Sisters and Messier 45 (M45), is an asterism of an open star cluster containing
    young B-type stars in the northwest of the constellation Taurus. At a distance
    of about 444 light-years, it is among the nearest star clusters to Earth and the
    nearest Messier object to Earth, being the most obvious star cluster to the naked
    eye in the night sky. It contains the reflection nebulae NGC 1432, an HII region,
    and NGC 1435, known as the Merope Nebula. Around 2330 BC the Pleiades marked the
    vernal point. Due to the brightness of its stars, the Pleiades is viewable from
    most areas on Earth, even in locations with significant light pollution.

    The cluster is dominated by hot blue luminous stars that have formed within the
    last 100 million years. Reflection nebulae around the brightest stars were once
    thought to be leftover material from their formation, but are now considered likely
    to be an unrelated dust cloud in the interstellar medium through which the stars
    are currently passing. This dust cloud is estimated to be moving at a speed of
    approximately 18 km/s relative to the stars in the cluster.

    Computer simulations have shown that the Pleiades were probably formed from a
    compact configuration that once resembled the Orion Nebula. Astronomers estimate
    that the cluster will survive for approximately another 250 million years, after
    which the clustering will be lost due to gravitational interactions with the galactic
    neighborhood.

    Together with the open star cluster of the Hyades, the Pleiades form the Golden
    Gate of the Ecliptic. The Pleiades have been said to "resemble a tiny dipper,"
    and should not be confused with the "Little Dipper," or Ursa Minor.'

  description_text: 'Messier 46 or M46, also known as NGC 2437, is an open cluster
    of stars in the slightly southern constellation of Puppis. It was discovered by
    Charles Messier in 1771.  Dreyer described it as "very bright, very rich, very
    large." It is about 5,000 light-years away. There are an estimated 500 stars in
    the cluster with a combined mass of 453 M☉, and it is thought to be a mid-range
    estimate of 251.2 million years old.

    The cluster has a very broadest (tidal) radius of 37.8 ± 4.6 ly (11.6 ± 1.4 pc)
    and core radius of 8.5 ± 1.3 ly (2.6 ± 0.4 pc). It has a greater spatial extent
    in infrared than in visible light, suggesting it is undergoing some mass segregation
    with the fainter (redder) stars migrating to a coma (tail) region. The fainter
    stars that extend out to the south and west may form a tidal tail due to a past
    interaction.

    The planetary nebula NGC 2438 appears to lie within the cluster near its northern
    edge (the faint almost rainbow array of colored smudge at the top-center of the
    image), but it is most likely unrelated since it does not share the cluster''s
    radial velocity. This makes for superimposed objects of interest, another instance
    perhaps being NGC 2818.

    On the other hand, the illuminating star of the bipolar Calabash Nebula shares
    the radial velocity and proper motion of Messier 46, and is at the same distance,
    so is a bona fide member of the open cluster.

    M46 is located close by to another open cluster, Messier 47. M46 is about a degree
    east of M47 in the sky, so the two fit well in a binocular or wide-angle telescope
    field.'

    limit with Monoceros, about 18° 34′ to the east and slightly south of Hydra''s
    brightest star, Alphard. This grouping was discovered by Charles Messier in 1771,
    but there is no cluster precisely where Messier indicated; he made an error, as
    he did with M47. The value that he gave for the right ascension matches, however,
    his declination is off by five degrees. Credit for discovery is sometimes given
    instead to Caroline Herschel in 1783. Her nephew John Herschel described it as,
    "a superb cluster which fills the whole field; stars of 9th and 10th to the 13th
    magnitude – and none below, but the whole ground of the sky on which it stands
    is singularly dotted over with infinitely minute points".

    M48 is visible to the naked eye under good atmospheric conditions. The brightest
    member is the star HIP 40348 at visual magnitude 8.3. The cluster is located some
    2,500 light-years from the Sun. The age estimated from isochrones is 400±100 Myr,
    while gyrochronology age estimate is 450±50 Myr – in good agreement. This makes
    it intermediate in age between the Pleiades, at around 100 Myr, and the Hyades,
    at about 650 Myr. The metallicity of the cluster, based on the abundance of iron
    (Fe), is [Fe/H] = −0.063±0.007 dex, where −1 would be ten times lower than in
    the Sun. It is more metal-poor than the Pleiades, Hyades, and Praesepe clusters.

    The cluster has a tidal radius of 63.3 ± 7.8 ly (19.4 ± 2.4 pc) with at least
    438 members and a mass of 2,366 M☉. The general structure of the cluster is fragmented
    and lumpy, which may be due to interactions with the galactic disk. The cluster
    is now subdivided into three groups, each of which has its own collective proper
    motion.

  description_text: 'Messier 49 (also known as M49 or NGC 4472) is a giant elliptical
    galaxy about 56 million light-years away in the equatorial constellation of Virgo.
    This galaxy was discovered by astronomer Charles Messier in 1777.

    As an elliptical galaxy, Messier 49 has the physical form of a radio galaxy, but
    it only has the radio emission of a normal galaxy. From the detected radio emission,
    the core region has roughly 1053 erg (1046 J or 1022 YJ) of synchrotron energy.
    The nucleus of this galaxy is emitting X-rays, suggesting the likely presence
    of a supermassive black hole with an estimated mass of 5.65 × 108 solar masses,
    or 565 million times the mass of the Sun (M☉). X-ray emissions shows a structure
    to the north of Messier 49 that resembles a bow shock. To the southwest of the
    core, the luminous outline of the galaxy can be traced out to a distance of 260
    kpc.

    This galaxy has many globular clusters: estimated to be about 5,900. This is far
    more than the roughly 200 orbiting the Milky Way, but dwarfed by the 13,450 orbiting
    the supergiant elliptical galaxy Messier 87. On average, the globular clusters
    of M49 are about 10 billion years old. Between 2000 and 2009, strong evidence
    for a stellar mass black hole was discovered in one. A second candidate was announced
    in 2011.

    Messier 49 was the first member of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies to be discovered.
    It is the most luminous member of that cluster and more luminous than any galaxy
    closer to the Earth. This galaxy forms part of the smaller Virgo B subcluster
    4.5° away from the dynamic center of the Virgo Cluster, centered on Messier 87.
    Messier 49 is gravitationally interacting with the dwarf irregular galaxy UGC
    7636. The dwarf shows a trail of debris spanning roughly 1 × 5 arcminutes, which
    corresponds to a physical dimension of 6 × 30 kpc.

    One supernova has been observed in M49: SN 1969Q (type unknown, mag. 13) was discovered
    by Evans on 12 June 1969. [Note: some sources incorrectly report the discovery
    date as 1 June 1969.]'

    with the nearest fellow member 8′ away and around 5 magnitudes fainter. The nearest
    cluster member of comparable brightness is the lenticular galaxy NGC 4638, which
    is around 17′ away. It and the angularly nearby elliptical galaxy Messier 60 were
    both discovered by Johann Gottfried Koehler in April 1779 when observing comet
    seeming close by. Charles Messier listed both in the Messier Catalogue about three
    days after Koehler''s discovery.

    This is an elliptical galaxy of type E5 with a position angle of 163.3°, indicating
    the overall shape shows a flattening of 50%. However, isophotes for this galaxy
    deviate from a perfect ellipticity, showing pointed shapes instead. These can
    be decomposed mathematically into a three component model, with each part having
    a different eccentricity. The main elliptical component appears to be superimposed
    upon a flatter, disk-like feature, with the entirety embedded within a circular
    halo. The luminosity contribution of the components is 62% for the pure elliptical
    part, 22% for the halo, and the remainder coming from the disk. The light ratio
    of the disk to the main elliptical body is 0.25, whereas it is typically closer
    to 0.5 in a lenticular galaxy.

    The core contains a supermassive black hole (SMBH), with a mass that has been
    estimated to be 270 million times the mass of the Sun, and counter-rotates with
    respect of the rest of the galaxy, being bluer. The SMBH is quiescent, but is
    detectable as an X-ray and radio source that indicates an outflow. The nucleus
    contains an embedded stellar disk that is bluer (younger) than the bulge region,
    with a blue component stretching along a position angle of around 150°. This extended
    disk feature may be the result of a galactic merger followed by a starburst event.

    Messier 59 is very rich in globular clusters, with a population of them that has
    been estimated to be around 2,200. It has two satellites, the ultra compact dwarf
    galaxy M59-UCD3 and M59cO, which is a rare example of a galaxy in between compact

  description_text: 'The Butterfly Cluster (cataloged as Messier 6 or M6, and as NGC
    6405) is an open cluster of stars in the southern constellation of Scorpius. Its
    name derives from the resemblance of its shape to a butterfly.

    The first astronomer to record the Butterfly Cluster''s existence was Giovanni
    Battista Hodierna in 1654. However, Robert Burnham Jr. has proposed that the 2nd
    century astronomer Ptolemy may have seen it with the naked eye while observing
    its neighbor the Ptolemy Cluster (M7). Credit for the discovery is usually given
    to Jean-Philippe Loys de Chéseaux in 1746. Charles Messier observed the cluster
    on May 23, 1764, and added it to his Messier Catalog.

    Estimates of the Butterfly Cluster''s distance have varied over the years. Wu
    et al. (2009) found a distance estimate of 1,590 light-years, giving it a spatial
    dimension of some 12 light years. Modern measurements show its total visual brightness
    to be magnitude 4.2. The cluster is estimated to be 94.2 million years old. Cluster
    members show a slightly higher abundance of elements heavier than helium compared
    to the Sun; what astronomers refer to as the metallicity.

    120 stars, ranging down to visual magnitude 15.1, have been identified as most
    likely cluster members. Most of the bright stars in this cluster are hot, blue
    B-type stars but the brightest member is a K-type orange giant star, BM Scorpii,
    which contrasts sharply with its blue neighbours in photographs. BM Scorpii, is
    classed as a semiregular variable star, its brightness varying from magnitude
    +5.5 to magnitude +7.0. There are also eight candidate chemically peculiar stars.

    The cluster is located 24.59 ± 0.13 kly (7.54 ± 0.04 kpc) from the Galactic Center
    and is following an orbit through the Milky Way galaxy with a low eccentricity
    of 0.03 and an orbital period of 204.2 Myr. At present it is 23 ly (7 pc) below
    the galactic plane, and it will cross the plane every 29.4 Myr.

  description_text: 'Messier 63 or M63, also known as NGC 5055 or the seldom-used
    Sunflower Galaxy, is a spiral galaxy in the northern constellation of Canes Venatici
    with approximately 400 billion stars. M63 was first discovered by the French astronomer
    Pierre Méchain, then later verified by his colleague Charles Messier on 14 June
    1779. The galaxy became listed as object 63 in the Messier Catalogue. In the mid-19th
    century, Anglo-Irish astronomer Lord Rosse identified spiral structures within
    the galaxy, making this one of the first galaxies in which such structure was
    identified.

    The shape or morphology of this galaxy has a classification of SAbc, indicating
    a spiral form with no central bar feature (SA) and moderate to loosely wound arms
    (bc). There is a general lack of large-scale continuous spiral structure in visible
    light, so it is considered a flocculent galaxy. However, when observed in the
    near infrared, a symmetric, two-arm structure is seen. Each arm wraps 150° around
    the galaxy and extends out to 13,000 light-years (4,000 parsecs) from the nucleus.

    M63 is a weakly active galaxy with a LINER nucleus – short for ''low-ionization
    nuclear emission-line region''. This displays as an unresolved source at the galactic
    nucleus that is cloaked in a diffuse emission. The latter is extended along a
    position angle of 110° relative to the north celestial pole, and both soft X-rays
    and hydrogen (H-alpha) emission can be observed coming from along nearly the same
    direction. The existence of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the nucleus is
    uncertain; if it does exist, then the mass is estimated as (8.5±1.9)×108 M☉, or
    around 850 million times the mass of the Sun.

    Radio observations at the 21-cm hydrogen line show the gaseous disk of M63 extends
    outward to a radius of 130,000 light-years (40 kiloparsecs), well past the bright
    optical disk. This gas shows a symmetrical form that is warped in a pronounced
    manner, starting at a radius of 33,000 light-years (10 kiloparsecs). The form
    suggests a dark matter halo that is offset with respect to the inner region. The
    reason for the warp is unclear, but the position angle points toward the smaller
    companion galaxy, UGC 8313.

    The distance to M63, based upon the luminosity-distance measurement is 29,300,000
    light-years (8.99 megaparsecs). The radial velocity relative to the Local Group
    yields an estimate of 15,200,000 light-years (4.65 megaparsecs). Estimates based
    on the Tully–Fisher relation range over 16,000,000–34,000,000 light-years (5.0–10.3
    megaparsecs). The tip of the red-giant branch technique gives a distance of 28,930,000
    ± 950,000 light-years (8.87 ± 0.29 megaparsecs). M63 is part of the M51 Group,
    a group of galaxies that also includes M51 (the ''Whirlpool Galaxy'').'

  description_text: 'The Black Eye Galaxy (also called Sleeping Beauty Galaxy or Evil
    Eye Galaxy and designated Messier 64, M64, or NGC 4826) is a relatively isolated
    spiral galaxy 17 million light-years away in the mildly northern constellation
    of Coma Berenices. It was discovered by Edward Pigott in March 1779, and independently
    by Johann Elert Bode in April of the same year, as well as by Charles Messier
    the next year. A dark band of absorbing dust partially in front of its bright
    nucleus gave rise to its nicknames of the "Black Eye", "Evil Eye", or "Sleeping
    Beauty" galaxy. M64 is well known among amateur astronomers due to its form in
    small telescopes and visibility across inhabited latitudes.

    This galaxy is inclined 60° to the line-of-sight and has a position angle of 112°.
    At the distance of this galaxy, it has a linear scale of 65 ly (20 pc) per arcsecond.
    The morphological classification in the De Vaucouleurs system is (R)SA(rs)ab,
    where the ''(R)'' indicates an outer ring-like structure, ''SA'' denotes a non-barred
    spiral, ''(rs)'' means a transitional inner ring/spiral structure, and ''ab''
    says the spiral arms are fairly tightly wound. Ann et al. (2015) gave it a class
    of SABa, suggesting a weakly barred spiral galaxy with tightly wound arms.

    M64 is a type 2 Seyfert galaxy with an HII/LINER nucleus. The central region is
    a weak source of radio emission. A soft X-ray source has been detected at the
    nucleus, which is most likely coming from the circumnuclear region rather than
    directly from an active galactic nucleus. There is an inner disk of molecular
    gas that is truncated at a radius of 2,300 ly (700 pc). At present, the non-rotational
    motions of this disk do not significantly feed the core, but the disk does produce
    a vigorous rate of star formation, with also approximately 100 billion stars inside
    the galaxy. There is also evidence of a recent large inflow of mass. The central
    supermassive black hole is calculated to have a mass of about 8.4×106 M☉.

    The interstellar medium of Messier 64 consists of two counter-rotating disks that
    are approximately equal in mass. The inner disk contains the prominent dust lanes
    of the galaxy. The stellar population of the galaxy exhibits no measurable counter-rotation.
    Possible formation scenarios include a merger with a gas-rich satellite galaxy
    in a retrograde orbit, or the continued accretion of gas clouds from the intergalactic
    medium. It has a diameter of 16.51 kiloparsecs (53,800 light-years).

    Messier 64 is part of the Virgo Supercluster.

    M65 and NGC 3628, known as the Leo Triplet or the M66 Group. M65 and M66 are a
    common object for amateur astronomic observation, being separated by only 20′.

    M66 has a morphological classification of SABb, indicating a spiral shape with
    a weak bar feature and loosely wound arms. The isophotal axis ratio is 0.32, indicating
    that it is being viewed at an angle. M66 is receding from us with a heliocentric
    radial velocity of 696.3±12.7 km/s. It lies 31 million light-years away and is
    about 95 thousand light-years across with striking dust lanes and bright star
    clusters along sweeping spiral arms.

    Gravitational interaction from its past encounter with neighboring NGC 3628 has
    resulted in an extremely high central mass concentration; a high molecular to
    atomic mass ratio; and a resolved non-rotating clump of H I material apparently
    removed from one of the spiral arms. The latter feature shows up visually as an
    extremely prominent and unusual spiral arm and dust lane structures as originally
    noted in the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies.'

    in the constellation of Ophiuchus. It is positioned in the southern part of the
    constellation to the southwest of Eta Ophiuchi, and lies atop a dark cloud of
    dust designated Barnard 64. The cluster was discovered by French astronomer Charles
    Messier on June 3, 1764, who described it as a "nebula without stars". In 1783,
    English astronomer William Herschel was able to use his reflector to resolve individual
    stars within the cluster. He estimated the cluster to be 7–8′ in diameter with
    stars densely packed near the center.

    M9 has an apparent magnitude of 7.9, an angular size of 9.3′, and can be viewed
    with a small telescope. It is one of the nearer globular clusters to the center
    of the galaxy as is around 5,500 light-years from the Galactic Center. Its distance
    from Earth is 25,800 light-years.

    The total luminosity of this cluster is around 120,000 times that of the Sun,
    the absolute magnitude being -8.04. The brightest individual stars in M9 are of
    apparent magnitude 13.5, making them visible in moderately sized telescopes. There
    have been 24 variable stars found in M9: 21 RR Lyrae variables, plus a long-period
    variable, Type II Cepheid, and an eclipsing binary. No blue stragglers or SX Phoenicis
    variables have been discovered. Based upon the periods of the RR Lyr variables,
    this cluster is classified as an Oosterhoff type II globular, which precludes
    an extra-galactic origin.

    At about 80'' (1+1⁄3 degrees) to the northeast of M9 is the dimmer globular cluster
    NGC 6356, while about the same to the southeast is the globular NGC 6342.'

    cross-section with a faint internal structure. It was formed from the outflow
    of material from the stellar wind of the central star as it evolved along the
    asymptotic giant branch. The nebula is arranged in three concentric shells, with
    the outermost shell being about 20–30% larger than the inner shell. The owl-like
    appearance of the nebula is the result of an inner shell that is not circularly
    symmetric, but instead forms a barrel-like structure aligned at an angle of 45°
    to the line of sight.

    The nebula holds about 0.13 solar masses (M☉) of matter, including hydrogen, helium,
    nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur; all with a density of less than 100 particles per
    cubic centimeter. Its outer radius is around 0.91 ly (0.28 pc) and it is expanding

  description_text: 'NGC 1055 is an edge-on spiral galaxy located in the constellation
    Cetus. The galaxy has a prominent nuclear bulge crossed by a wide, knotty, dark
    lane of dust and gas.  The spiral arm structure appears to be elevated above the
    galaxy''s plane and obscures the upper half of the bulge. It was discovered by
    German-British astronomer William Herschel on December 18, 1783, from his home
    in Slough, England.


    NGC 1055 is a binary system together with the bright spiral galaxy M77 (NGC 1068).
    These two are the largest galaxies of a small galaxy group that also includes
    NGC 1073, and five other small irregular galaxies.

    NGC 1087, NGC 1090, and NGC 1094 appear close, but they simply appear in the field
    of view and are background galaxies.

    Based on the published redshift, (Hubble Constant of 62 km/s per Mpc) a rough
    distance estimate for NGC 1055 is 52 million light-years, with a diameter of about
    114,400 light-years. The separation between NGC 1055 and M77 is about 7 million
    light-years.

    NGC 1055 is a bright infrared and radio source, particularly in the wavelength
    for warm carbon monoxide. Astronomers believe that this results from unusually
    active star formation. It most likely has a transitional nucleus, however, there
    is a small chance that it could be a LINER.'

  description_text: "NGC 1333 is a reflection nebula located in the northern constellation\
    \ Perseus, positioned next to the southern constellation border with Taurus and\
    \ Aries. It was first discovered by German astronomer Eduard Schönfeld in 1855.\
    \ The nebula is visible as a hazy patch in a small telescope, while a larger aperture\
    \ will show a pair of dark nebulae designated Barnard 1 and Barnard 2. It is associated\
    \ with a dark cloud L1450 (Barnard 205). Estimates of the distance to this nebula\
    \ range from 980–1,140 ly (300–350 pc). \nThis nebula is in the western part of\
    \ the Perseus molecular cloud and is a young region of very active star formation,\
    \ being one of the best-studied objects of its type. It contains a fairly typical\
    \ hierarchy of star clusters that are still embedded in the molecular cloud in\
    \ which they formed, which are split into two main sub-groups to the north and\
    \ south. Most of the infrared emission is happening in the southern part of the\
    \ nebula. A significant portion of the stars seen in the infrared are in the pre-main\
    \ sequence stage of their evolution.\nThe nebula region has a combined mass of\
    \ approximately 450 M☉, while the cluster contains around 150 stars with a median\
    \ age of a million years and a combined mass of 100 M☉. The average star formation\
    \ rate is 1×10−4 M☉ yr–1.  Within the nebula are 20 young stellar objects producing\
    \ outflows, including Herbig–Haro objects, and a total of 95 X-ray sources that\
    \ are associated with known members of embedded star clusters. In 2011 researchers\
    \ reported finding 30 to 40 brown dwarf objects in the cloud and in the Rho Ophiuchi\
    \ cloud complex.\n15 objects with a spectral type of M9 or later were discovered\
    \ in NGC 1333. This spectral type corresponds to a mass of a planetary-mass object\
    \ (PMO) at the age of NGC 1333. About 42% of the PMO are surrounded by a circumstellar\
    \ disk, but only one out of six objects with a spectral type of L0 (about 10 MJ)\
    \ or later has a disk. Scholz et al. argues that this indicates that very low\
    \ mass PMOs form like planets (aka ejected planets) and not like stars (also called\
    \ sub-brown dwarfs). Parker & Alves de Oliveira on the other hand argue that the\
    \ distribution of PMOs in NGC 1333 follows N-body simulations of objects that\
    \ form like stars and that none of the PMOs has a peculiar motion, which is predicted\
    \ for ejected planets. They also note that ejected planets are hiding in this\
    \ and other star-forming regions. Additional PMOs were discovered by Scholz et\
    \ al. 2012 with Subaru (e.g. SONYC-NGC1333-36 with estimated 6 MJ) and by Langeveld\
    \ et al. 2024 with JWST (6 objects and one JuMBO candidate). Langeveld et al.\
    \ did not find any object below 4 MJ, despite JWST being sensitive enough to detect\
    \ these objects. This could mean that star-formation does not occur below 4 MJ,\
    \ which is consistent with previous observations in most star-forming regions\
    \ and the nearby stellar population. One source, called NIRISS-NGC1333-5 (NN5),\
    \ shows infrared excess, which is an indication of a disk around the object. With\
    \ a mass of 5 MJ, this object could be one of the lowest mass object with a disk\
    \ known so far."

  description_text: 'NGC 1360, also known as the Robin''s Egg Nebula,  is a planetary
    nebula in the constellation of Fornax. It was identified as a planetary nebula
    due to its strong radiation in the OIII (oxygen) bands. Reddish matter, believed
    to have been ejected from the original star before its final collapse, is visible
    in images. It is slightly fainter than IC 2003.

    The central star of the system was suspected to be binary since 1977, but was
    only confirmed in 2017. The central source consists of a low-mass O-type star
    and a white dwarf, with masses of 0.555 M☉ and 0.679 M☉ respectively.

    NGC 1360 was discovered in January 1868 by the German astronomer Friedrich August
    Theodor Winnecke.'

  description_text: 'NGC 1851 (also known as Caldwell 73) is a relatively massive
    globular cluster located in the southern constellation of Columba. Astronomer
    John Dreyer described it as not very bright but very large, round, well resolved,
    and clearly consisting of stars. It is located 39.5 kilolight-years from the Sun,
    and 54.1 kilolight-years from the Galactic Center. The cluster is following a
    highly eccentric orbit through the galaxy, with an eccentricity of about 0.7.

    This object has a Shapley–Sawyer Concentration Class of II, indicating a dense
    central concentration. It has one of the highest concentrations known for Galactic
    globular clusters. The stellar components show two separate populations of subgiant
    stars, with the brighter branch being more concentrated in the outer regions of
    the cluster. NGC 1851 is an estimated 9.2 billion years old with 551,000 times
    the mass of the Sun.

    The cluster is surrounded by a diffuse halo of stars that stretches outward to
    a radius of 240 pc or more. This feature, if combined with the lack of tidal tail
    or associated stream of stars, suggests the cluster may be a stripped dwarf galaxy
    nucleus, similar to Omega Centauri, that has been accreted by the Milky Way. The
    tidal tail is still present though. It is also possible the cluster is the result
    of the merger of two separate clusters, but the fact that they would need to have
    the same metallicity – what astronomers term the abundance of elements other than
    hydrogen and helium – makes this scenario less likely.

    PSR J0514-4002A is a millisecond pulsar in NGC 1851. It is orbiting a massive
    object that may also be a neutron star. The pair have an orbital period of 18.8
    days with a large eccentricity of 0.89. A nearby pulsar PSR J0514−4002E is orbiting
    a massive object which appears to occupy the "mass gap" between the heaviest neutron
    stars and the lightest black holes, making it an unusual star system which may
    be useful for studying theories of gravity. The TRAPUM Large Survey Project using
    the MeerKAT radio telescope discovered thirteen new pulsars in the cluster, which
    consist of six isolated millisecond pulsars (MSPs) and seven binary pulsars, of
    which six are MSPs and one is mildly recycled.  43 RR Lyrae variables have been
    discovered in the cluster, which show this to be an Oosterhoff type I cluster
    but having properties similar to type II. Two populations of horizontal branch
    stars have been observed, with the pair having an age difference of around two
    billion years. Spectroscopic analysis of the red giant branch member stars suggests
    there are actually three different populations of stars in the cluster.'

    in the constellation Canis Major. The nebula is approximately 3,670 parsecs (11.96
    thousand light years) away and 30 light-years in size.  The central star is the
    Wolf-Rayet star WR7, an extremely hot star thought to be in a brief pre-supernova
    stage of evolution. It is similar in nature to the Bubble Nebula, but interactions
    with a nearby large molecular cloud are thought to have contributed to the more
    complex shape and curved bow-shock structure of Thor''s Helmet.

    It is also catalogued as Sharpless 2-298 and Gum 4.

    The nebula has an overall bubble shape, but with complex filamentary structures.  The
    nebula contains several hundred solar masses of ionised material, plus several
    thousand more of unionised gas.  It is largely interstellar material swept up
    by winds from the central star, although some material does appear to be enriched
    with the products of fusion and is likely to come directly from the star.  The
    expansion rate of different portions of the nebula varies from 10 km/s to at least
    30 km/s, leading to age estimates of 78,500 - 236,000 years.  The nebula has been
    studied at radio and x-ray wavelengths, but it is still unclear whether it was
    produced at the class O main sequence stage of development, as a red supergiant,
    luminous blue variable, or mainly as a Wolf-Rayet star.

  description_text: 'NGC 2419 (also known as Caldwell 25) is a globular cluster in
    the constellation Lynx. It was discovered by William Herschel on December 31,
    1788. NGC 2419 is at a distance of about 300,000 light years from the Solar System
    and at the same distance from the Galactic Center.

    NGC 2419 bears the nickname "the Intergalactic Wanderer," which was bestowed when
    it was erroneously thought not to be in orbit around the Milky Way.  Its orbit
    takes it farther away from the galactic center than the Magellanic Clouds, but
    it can (with qualifications) be considered as part of the Milky Way. At this great
    distance it takes three billion years to make one trip around the galaxy.

    The cluster is dim in comparison to more famous globular clusters such as M13.
    Nonetheless, NGC 2419 is a 9th magnitude object and is readily viewed, in good
    sky conditions, with good quality telescopes as small as 102mm (four inches) in
    aperture. Intrinsically it is one of the brightest and most massive globular clusters
    of our galaxy, having an absolute magnitude of −9.42 and being 900,000 times more
    massive than the Sun.

    It was proposed that NGC 2419 could be, as Omega Centauri, the remnant of a dwarf
    spheroidal galaxy disrupted and accreted by the Milky Way. However, that hypothesis
    has been disputed.

    Astronomer Leos Ondra has noted that NGC 2419 would be the "best and brightest"
    for any observers in the Andromeda Galaxy, looking for globular clusters in our
    galaxy since it lies outside the obscuring density of the main disk. This is analogous
    to the way the cluster G1 can be seen orbiting outside of the Andromeda Galaxy
    from Earth.

    It was found to be composed of two different populations, one being more helium-rich
    than the other, which does not fit the current model for globular cluster formation
    (which leads to a very homogeneous population in the cluster). This raises new
    questions on how this globular cluster was formed.'

  description_text: 'The Beehive Cluster (also known as Praesepe (Latin for "manger",
    "cot" or "crib"), M44, NGC 2632, or Cr 189) is an open cluster in the constellation
    Cancer. One of the nearest open clusters to Earth, it contains a larger population
    of stars than other nearby bright open clusters holding around 1,000 stars. Under
    dark skies, the Beehive Cluster looks like a small nebulous object to the naked
    eye, and has been known since ancient times. Classical astronomer Ptolemy described
    it as a "nebulous mass in the breast of Cancer". It was among the first objects
    that Galileo studied with his

    telescope.

    Its age and proper motion coincide with those of the Hyades, suggesting they may
    share similar origins. Both clusters also contain red giants and white dwarfs,
    which represent later stages of stellar evolution, along with many main sequence
    stars.

    The distance to M44 is often cited to be between 160 and 187 parsecs (520–610
    light years), but the revised Hipparcos parallaxes (2009) for Praesepe members
    and the latest infrared color-magnitude diagram favors an analogous distance of
    182 pc. There are better age estimates of around 600 million years (compared to
    about 625 million years for the Hyades). The diameter of the bright inner cluster
    core is about 7.0 parsecs (23 light years).

    At 1.5° across, the cluster easily fits within the field of view of binoculars
    or low-powered small telescopes. Regulus, Castor, and Pollux are guide stars.'

  description_text: 'NGC 2903 is an isolated barred spiral galaxy in the equatorial
    constellation of Leo, positioned about 1.5° due south of Lambda Leonis. It was
    discovered by German-born astronomer William Herschel, who cataloged it on November
    16, 1784. He mistook it as a double nebula, as did subsequent observers, and it
    wasn''t until the nineteenth century that the Third Earl of Rosse resolved into
    a spiral form. J. L. E. Dreyer assigned it the identifiers 2903 and 2905 in his
    New General Catalogue; NGC 2905 now designates a luminous knot in the northeastern
    spiral arm.

    This field galaxy is located about 30 million light-years away from the Milky
    Way, and is a member of the Virgo Supercluster. The morphological classification
    of this galaxy is SBbc, indicating a barred spiral (SB) with moderate to tightly-wound
    spiral arms (bc). De Vaucouleurs and associates assigned it the class SAB(rs)bc,
    suggesting a weaker bar structure (SAB) with a partial ring (rs). The bar structure
    appears stronger in the near infrared band. The galaxy as a whole is inclined
    by an angle of 60° to the line of sight from the Earth.

    72% of the stellar mass is located in the outer disk of the galaxy, and 20% is
    found in the bar. The bulge adds 5% of the stellar mass, and its star population
    is generally older. However, the central ~650 pc radius volume of the core is
    a strong starburst region. The star formation rate here is 0.7 M☉ y−1 and it is
    being fed by gas inflow along the bar. There is no evidence of an active nucleus.

    The irregular dwarf galaxy KKH 51 appears to be a companion, as they have an angular
    separation of 25′ and nearly the same radial velocity.'

    The SMC is visible from the entire Southern Hemisphere and can be fully glimpsed
    low above the southern horizon from latitudes south of about 15° north. The galaxy
    is located across the constellation of Tucana and part of Hydrus, appearing as

    an average apparent diameter of about 4.2° (8 times the Moon''s) and thus covers
    an area of about 14 square degrees (70 times the Moon''s). Since its surface brightness
    is very low, this deep-sky object is best seen on clear moonless nights and away
    from city lights. The SMC forms a pair with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC),
    which lies 20° to the east, and, like the LMC, is a member of the Local Group.

    also known as the Great Carina Nebula) is a large, complex area of bright and
    dark nebulosity in the constellation Carina, located in the Carina–Sagittarius
    Arm of the Milky Way galaxy. The nebula is approximately 8,500 light-years (2,600
    pc) from Earth.

    The nebula has within its boundaries the large Carina OB1 association and several
    related open clusters, including numerous O-type stars and several Wolf–Rayet
    stars. Carina OB1 encompasses the star clusters Trumpler 14 and Trumpler 16. Trumpler
    14 is one of the youngest known star clusters at half a million years old and
    contains stars like the O2 supergiant HD 93129A. Trumpler 16 is the home of many
    extremely luminous stars, such as WR 25 and the Eta Carinae star system. Trumpler
    15, Collinder 228, Collinder 232, NGC 3324, and NGC 3293 are also considered members
    of the association. NGC 3293 is the oldest and furthest from Trumpler 14, indicating
    sequential and ongoing star formation.

    The nebula is one of the largest diffuse nebulae in Earth''s sky. Although it
    is four times as large as and even brighter than the famous Orion Nebula, the
    Carina Nebula is much less well known due to its location in the southern sky.
    It was discovered by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille in 1752 from the Cape of Good Hope.

    The Carina Nebula was selected as one of five cosmic objects observed by the James
    Webb Space Telescope, as part of the release of its first official science images.
    A detailed image was made of an early star-forming region of NGC 3324 known as

  description_text: 'NGC 3628, also known as the Hamburger Galaxy or Sarah''s Galaxy,
    is an unbarred spiral galaxy about 35 million light-years away in the constellation
    Leo. It was discovered by William Herschel in 1784. It has an approximately 300,000
    light-years long tidal tail. Along with M65 and M66, NGC 3628 forms the  Leo Triplet,
    a small group of galaxies. Its most conspicuous feature is the broad and obscuring
    band of dust located along the outer edge of its spiral arms, effectively transecting
    the galaxy to the view from Earth.

    Due to the presence of an x-shaped bulge, visible in multiple wavelengths, it
    has been argued that NGC 3628 is instead a barred spiral galaxy with the bar seen
    end-on. Simulations have shown that bars often form in disk galaxies during interactions
    and mergers, and NGC 3628 is known to be interacting with its two large neighbors.

    When viewed through a telescope, its often seen as a dim orb, as it has a relatively
    low surface brightness for a supposedly famous galaxy. Though, when viewed with
    a larger one, it begins to show off more of its intricate detail such as its prominent
    dust lane, obscuring its core.

    The name "Hamburger Galaxy" is a reference to its shape resembling a hamburger,
    while the name "Sarah''s Galaxy" is thought to refer to poet Sarah Williams (1837–1868),
    most famous for the poem "The Old Astronomer:"'

    from the Milky Way. NGC 4725 is the brightest member of the Coma I Group of the
    Coma-Sculptor Cloud, although it is relatively isolated from the other members
    of this group. This galaxy is strongly disturbed and is interacting with neighboring
    spiral galaxy NGC 4747, with its spiral arms showing indications of warping. The
    pair have an angular separation of 24′, which corresponds to a projected linear
    separation of 370 kly. A tidal plume extends from NGC 4747 toward NGC 4725.


    NGC 4725 is a suspected type 2 Seyfert galaxy with a supermassive black hole at
    the core. The morphological classification of this galaxy is SAB(r)ab pec, indicating
    a peculiar, weakly-barred spiral galaxy (SAB) with a complete ring surrounding
    the bar (r) and somewhat tightly-wound spiral arms (ab). It is actually double-barred,
    a feature found among about a third of all barred spirals. The galactic plane
    is inclined by approximately 46° to the line of sight from the Earth.

    The ring structure of the galaxy is a region of star formation. It is offset from
    the galactic center and displays non-circular motion. There is a compact radio
    source positioned approximately 6.2 kly from the nucleus of NGC 4725. Since there
    is no optical counterpart at that position, this may be a star forming region
    that is heavily obscured by dust.'

  description_text: 'Centaurus A (also known as NGC 5128 or Caldwell 77) is a galaxy
    in the constellation of Centaurus. It was discovered in 1826 by Scottish astronomer
    James Dunlop from his home in Parramatta, in New South Wales, Australia. There
    is considerable debate in the literature regarding the galaxy''s fundamental properties
    such as its Hubble type (lenticular galaxy or a giant elliptical galaxy) and distance
    (11–13 million light-years). It is the closest radio galaxy to Earth, as well
    as the closest BL Lac object, so its active galactic nucleus has been extensively
    studied by professional astronomers. The galaxy is also the fifth-brightest in
    the sky, making it an ideal amateur astronomy target. It is only visible from
    the southern hemisphere and low northern latitudes.

    The center of the galaxy contains a supermassive black hole with a mass of 55
    million solar masses, which ejects a relativistic jet that is responsible for
    emissions in the X-ray and radio wavelengths.  By taking radio observations of
    the jet separated by a decade, astronomers have determined that the inner parts
    of the jet are moving at about half of the speed of light. X-rays are produced
    farther out as the jet collides with surrounding gases, resulting in the creation
    of highly energetic particles. The X-ray jets of Centaurus A are thousands of
    light-years long, while the radio jets are over a million light-years long.

    It is also one of the nearest large starburst galaxies, of which a galactic collision
    is suspected to be responsible for an intense burst of star formation. Models
    have suggested that Centaurus A was a large elliptical galaxy that collided with
    a smaller spiral galaxy, with which it will eventually merge. For that reason,
    the galaxy has been of particular interest to astronomers for years. While collisions
    of spiral galaxies are relatively common, the effects of a collision between an
    elliptical and a spiral galaxy are not fully understood.'

  description_text: 'NGC 6441, sometimes also known as the Silver Nugget Cluster,
    is a globular cluster in the southern constellation of Scorpius. It was discovered
    by the Scottish astronomer James Dunlop on May 13, 1826, who described it as "a
    small, well-defined rather bright nebula, about 20″ in diameter". The cluster
    is located 5 arc minutes east-northeast of the star G Scorpii, and is some 43,000
    light-years from the Sun.

    This is one of the most massive and luminous globular clusters in the Milky Way,
    with an estimated 1.6 million solar masses of stars. It is located in the bulge
    of the galaxy at a distance of 13 kilolight-years (3.9 kpc) from the core, and
    is considered metal "rich". That is, it has a relatively high abundance of elements
    with higher mass than helium. The core region of the cluster subtends an angle
    of 0.11 arc minutes, compared to the half-mass radius of 0.64 arc minutes. The
    density of stars in the core region is indicated by the luminosity density: 5.25
    L⊙ pc−3. The cluster has a half-light radius of 7.1 ly (2.18 pc).

    This cluster has an abnormally large number of RR Lyrae variables—68 candidates
    as of 2006, and their periods are longer than is typical for their respective
    metallicities. (The mean period for the cluster''s RRab stars is 0.759 day.) There
    are also several type II Cepheid stars, which is unusual given the high metallicity
    of this cluster. Examination of the red giant branch section of the color-magnitude
    diagram suggests that there are at least two and possibly three distinct populations
    in the cluster. The brightest and higher temperature members of the red clump
    stars are more concentrated toward the center of the cluster. This group may be
    a helium-enriched second generation of stars.

    The cluster contains at least four millisecond pulsars, of which two are in binary
    systems. One of these binaries, PSR J1750−37A, is in a highly eccentric orbit
    with an eccentricity of 0.71. The cluster has an X-ray burster, X1746-370, which
    has the longest period known in any globular cluster and is consistent with the
    galaxy as a whole. Finally, there is a planetary nebula, JaFu 2, one of only four
    planetary nebulas known to inhabit globular clusters in the Milky Way.'

  description_text: 'NGC 660 is a peculiar and unique polar-ring galaxy located approximately
    45 million light-years from Earth in the Pisces constellation. It is the only
    such galaxy having, as its host, a "late-type lenticular galaxy". It was probably
    formed when two galaxies collided a billion years ago. However, it may have first
    started as a disk galaxy that captured matter from a passing galaxy. This material
    could have, over time, become "strung out" to form a rotating ring.

    The ring is not actually polar, but rather has an inclination from the plane of
    the host disk of approximately 45 degrees. The extreme number of pinkish star-forming
    areas that occurs along the galaxy''s ring could be the result of the gravitation
    interaction caused by this collision. The ring is 50,000 light-years across –
    much broader than the disk itself – and has a greater amount of gas and star formation
    than the host disk. This likely indicates a very violent origin. The polar ring
    contains objects numbering in the hundreds, many of which are red and blue supergiant
    stars. The most recently created stars in the ring are approximately 7 million
    years old. This indicates that the formation of these stars has been a long process
    and is still occurring.

    Data about the dark matter halo of NGC 660 can be extracted by observing the gravitational
    effects of the dark matter on the disk and ring''s rotation. From the core of
    the disk, radio waves are being emitted. The source of these waves is an area
    only 21 light-years across. This may indicate the presence of a super-cluster
    of stars located within an area of cloud of gas. The region in the centre has
    a vast amount of star formation, so luminous that it is considered to be a starburst
    galaxy.

    Late in 2012, this polar-ring galaxy produced an enormous outburst having a magnitude
    of approximately ten times brighter than a supernova explosion. The cause is not
    certain, but this event may have resulted from a tremendous jet being emanated
    from the galaxy''s central black hole.

    NGC 660 is a member of the M74 Group.'

    is based on direct astrometric measurements. (The distance estimates affect also
    the estimates of size and age.)

    The Hubble Space Telescope captured several images of the nebula. The analysis
    of the emissions from the nebula indicates the presence of oxygen, sulfur, and
    hydrogen. The Cygnus Loop is also a strong emitter of radio waves and x-rays.'

    about 13.427 megaparsecs (43.79 million light-years) away in the constellation

    The galaxy appears similar almost in size and structure to the Milky Way, and
    is sometimes referred to as "the Milky Way''s twin". However, discoveries in the
    2000s regarding the structure of the Milky Way may call this similarity into doubt,
    particularly because the latter is now believed to be a barred spiral, compared
    to the unbarred status of NGC 7331. In spiral galaxies the central bulge typically
    co-rotates with the disk but the bulge in the galaxy NGC 7331 is rotating in the
    opposite direction to the rest of the disk. In both visible light and infrared
    photos of the NGC 7331, the core of the galaxy appears to be slightly off-center,

  description_text: 'NGC 7380 is a young open cluster of stars in the northern circumpolar
    constellation of Cepheus, discovered by Caroline Herschel in 1787. The surrounding
    emission nebulosity is known colloquially as the Wizard Nebula, which spans an
    angle of 25′. German-born astronomer William Herschel included his sister''s discovery
    in his catalog, and labelled it H VIII.77. The nebula is  known as S 142 in the
    1959 Sharpless catalog (Sh2-142). It is extremely difficult to observe visually,
    usually requiring very dark skies and an O-III filter. The NGC 7380 complex is
    located at a distance of approximately 8.5 kilolight-years from the Sun, in the
    Perseus Arm of the Milky Way.

    The cluster spans ~20 light-years (6 pc) with an elongated shape and an extended
    tail. Age estimates range from 4 to 11.9 million years. At the center of the cluster
    lies DH Cephei, a close, double-lined spectroscopic binary system consisting of
    two massive O-type stars. This pair are the primary ionizing source for the surrounding
    H II region, and are driving out the surrounding gas and dust while triggering
    star formation in the neighboring region. Of the variable stars that have been
    identified in the cluster, 14 have been identified as pre-main sequence stars
    while 17 are main sequence stars that are primarily B-type variables.'

    The nebula is near a giant molecular cloud which contains the expansion of the

    884.

    NGC 869 and 884 are often designated h and χ (chi) Persei, respectively. Some
    confusion surrounds what Bayer intended by these designations. It is sometimes
    claimed that Bayer did not resolve the pair into two patches of nebulosity, and
    that χ refers to the Double Cluster and h to a nearby star. Bayer''s Uranometria
    chart for Perseus does not show them as nebulous objects, but his chart for Cassiopeia
    does, and they are described as Nebulosa Duplex in Schiller''s Coelum Stellatum
    Christianum, which was assembled with Bayer''s help. The clusters are both located
    in the Perseus OB1 association, a few hundred light years apart from each other.
    The clusters were first recorded by Hipparchus, thus have been known since antiquity.

    The Double Cluster is often photographed and observed with small telescopes. The
    clusters are visible with the unaided eye between the constellations of Perseus
    and Cassiopeia as a brighter patch in the winter Milky Way. In small telescopes,
    the cluster appears as an assemblage of bright stars located in a rich star field.
    Dominated by bright blue stars, the cluster also hosts a few orange stars.'

  description_text: Sh 2-308, also designated as Sharpless 308, RCW 11, or LBN 1052,
    and commonly known as the Dolphin-Head Nebula, is an H II region located near
    the center of the constellation Canis Major, composed of ionised hydrogen. It
    is about 8 degrees south of Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky. The nebula
    is bubble-like and surrounds a Wolf–Rayet star named EZ Canis Majoris. This star
    is in the brief, pre-supernova phase of its stellar evolution. The nebula is about
    4,530 light-years (1,389 parsecs) away from Earth, but some sources indicate that
    both the star and the nebula are up to 5,870 ly (1,800 pc) away. Yet others indicate
    the nebula is as close as 1,875 ly (575 pc) from Earth.

  description_text: "Simeis 147, also known as the Spaghetti Nebula, SNR G180.0-01.7\
    \ or Sharpless 2-240, is a supernova remnant (SNR) in the Milky Way, straddling\
    \ the border between the constellations Auriga and Taurus. It was discovered in\
    \ 1952 at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory by Grigory Shajn and his team\
    \ using a Schmidt camera and a narrowband filter close to the Hydrogen Alpha transmission\
    \ line. It is difficult to observe due to its extremely low surface brightness.\
    \ This discovery was part of a survey conducted between 1945 and 1955, most likely\
    \ using captured German equipment, as the observatory was practically destroyed\
    \ during WWII. The Schmidt camera had a field of view of 175'. Many previously\
    \ unknown hydrogen nebula were discovered this way, as they are not readily visible\
    \ in regular photographs. \nThe nebulous area has an almost spherical shell and\
    \ a filamentary structure. The remnant has an apparent diameter of approximately\
    \ 3 degrees, an estimated distance of approximately 3000 (±350) light-years, and\
    \ an age of approximately 40,000 years. At that distance, it spans roughly 160\
    \ lightyears.\nIt is believed that the stellar explosion left behind a rapidly\
    \ spinning neutron star known as pulsar PSR J0538+2817 in the nebula core, emitting\
    \ a strong radio signal."
